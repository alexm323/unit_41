Server vs Client Routing
_________________________________________________________________
react router is a library that lets us implement client side routing 

basic goals 
1. what is client side routing and why its useful
2. compare client side routing to server side routing
3. implement basic client-side routing with React Router 

server-side routing 
traditionally we send a request to a server/url and we are asking for some path or whatever the url is 
that server receives the request, parses it, and replaces the screen with that new content 

its kind of like a stage where its the same stage but something is happening to make the stage different 

this makes the websites a whole lot more usable 

we are going to make a janky version so we can see why we might want to use a library like react router 

_________________________________________________________________
Janky Client Side Routing
_________________________________________________________________
lets make a version of the client side routing without the library first 

we are basically manipulating the dom to show us only data for the particular page that we want to show 

this is generally not a good solution because we lose access to saving that particular url and we can not use back and forward functionality 

react router solves this issue for us 
_________________________________________________________________
Defining Routes
_________________________________________________________________
we can add in real client side routing 

there are a couple of different routing libraries that are popular and we are going to be using react router 

sites that exclusively use client-side routing are single page applications 
we can use client side routing to do this 

it uses the History api in the browser to do this 

reacttraining.com/react-router

there are 2 versions, web and native 

npm install react-router-dom

we need to install it and import it 

specifically we want to import 

import {BrowserRouter,Route} from "react-router-dom";

wrap the things that need routing with Browser Router 

for example we might have a navbar that we want to keep the same on every 'page' 

BrowserRouter makes it so we keep in sync with the url 

there are others

memoryrouter keeps a history of the url in memory but does not replace the page useful for testing 

inside of our browserrouter we have our different props we can pass in to our routes 

Route component acts as a translater between routes and components 

exact tells that route component whether or not the path needs to match exactly 

path prop specifies which path we are trying to match 

if we remove the exact prop then unlike the other routing things we have used if multiple routes match it will render all of them 

we usually dont want that but there are times where it can be useful 



_________________________________________________________________
Router Links
_________________________________________________________________
lets add in some links so we can travel around the routes 

we dont add in an anchor tag but we use a <Link> component from the react-router-dom library 

it creates what looks like an anchor tag but there is some extra js on the back 

works just like a link but it wont refresh the page 

<Link> does not send a GET request the JS intercepts it and shows us what we are looking for. 

if we put the links inside of a route component then it will only render on that component 


_________________________________________________________________
NavLinks
_________________________________________________________________
it does the same thing as link for the most part 

<NavLink> is going to add a class of active to whichever nav link is currently active 

so if we were on a certain page something could be hilighted to show us exactly which link is active at this time 

we can also add in the exact prop to the navlink so we can match only the active one
