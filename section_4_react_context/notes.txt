Prop Drilling
___________________________________________________
There is a newer api called React Context 

THere is a pain point 

explain what context is 
how to sue the context api to provide and consume context

passing data down from the parent to the child to the grandchild 

if it needs access to the top level component data it can be annoying that to share data we would need to pass it down all the way through

-TodoApp - [{id:1, text:'walk the dog'}]
    -TodoForm
    -TodosList
        -TodoItems

so here if we wanted an li at the bottom level with the data from the top level component which has the state it would be difficult to access it in a more complicated app 


___________________________________________________
Consuming Context
___________________________________________________
lets us have universal context so we can access it and it allows us to pass data in certain portions of certain components 

we create context 

that makes a context object

now we have to use the provider 

then we wrap whatever we want inside of that context provider 

every context provider accepts a value but we only pass in one thing and that can have as many things 

the next piece though is that now we have to use useContext hook to explicitly access that context in our bottom component or wherever we want that data 

only things nested within the provider are able to consume it

Context Updating State
___________________________________________________

Another Context Example
___________________________________________________
it looks pretty easy to use 

we set a thing like 

ThemeContext at the top level and we import stuff into the files we want to use them annd then we take advantage of something like 

const color = useContext(ThemeContext)

and then we get access to that color as long as the ThemeContext is wrapping the components that we are trying to nest 

in this case the <Child/> Component 

so now we can use our theme context to grab that data 

we can use state and pass that through as well and we can do stuff like toggling or using state 

remember that we can pass in all the components inbside of another one by using the children prop which is a prop we have access to that gives us any of the component stuff we pass downh that are nested
